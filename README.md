This program has been created for comparing biomedical research images.
The user must use this software at their own risk.
This program must not be used for any unlawful purposes.
This program requires R and RStudio to run.
This program is based on R.
For users who plan to install this on a server, we will create an image built using Docker Desktop application soon. The user interface will be available from the port mapped to port 3838, the port used by this application.
For users who plan to use a local installation, we recommend that the app is run through RStudio, which automatically installs the required packages. Further details of local installation are provided below.
Please download R from https://www.r-project.org/.
Please download RStudio from https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/.
Install R first and then RStudio.
Open the file "Compare_images.R" in RStudio.
Allow RStudio to install the necessary packages by clicking on install before you run. You must have the rights to install the libraries on the computer.
You can also host this as a shiny app to enable people without access to installations of R and RStudio.
You can find further instructions on the left panel on how to perform the necessary functions.
The prompts and messages also guide you on the process.
The results of some tests that we performed are available as "test_results.zip".
The codes used for testing are avaiable in "Compare_images_testing.R".
